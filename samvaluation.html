Her torpedo damage is pretty good, which along with her AoA and torpedo reload reduction make her damage output on the higher end for supports. She prefers to use a fast main gun to get as many All-out-Assault activations as possible. Her CV support is top-notch; her CV/CVL heal is nice in extended fights. Overall, she is a great option.</p>

                                    <p>Emden is a damage-oriented CL with great stats and skills. She has top CL damage due to her strong barrages and guns, plus an interesting torpedo gimmick. CL gun mode has more damage, but DD gun mode has slightly less damage for solid utility. Either mode works extremely well. Bulk is average, but DD gun mode's heal helps. Overall, she is VERY good.

                                    <p>Lützow is a flagship-oriented BC, with solid stats and an alright barrage. Has a meh debuff, and is otherwise very "traditional."

                                    <p>Seydlitz is an off-flag oriented BC with great stats and skills. She can off-flag if needed. You want her to have a high % of health as possible, although the damage redistribution goes against that. Main gun salvo reduction is great in mobbing, and she can give other SMS BB/BC the same reduction. Damage output is also fairly solid, making her great in bosses. Overall seems great; nothing exceptional, but she has great damage and the first salvo cooldown reduction. Typical event SSR.

Her debuffs are amazing, allowing the entire fleet to take advantage of them. Her personal damage is no joke either. Secondary crit rate buff looks nice on paper but is useless outside W14. Has crossfleet barrage and buff to HMS.

Don't pair her with Prince of Wales or Repulse (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Repulse META" title="Repulse META">Repulse META</a> is fine, but not necessary!), and ideally she is sortied without her fellow Illustrious-class sisters as well. Her 6 fighter 2 torpedo bomber loadout is very nice against light and medium armor targets when equipped with the BF-109G, and has a nice balance of damage and AA with a traditional fighter. Barrages add more free damage as well. Overall she's solid; not top tier but not bad.</p>

                                    <p>Jervis is a mob-tank oriented DD with great stats and skills. Her AoA barrage is good, making her damage output solid. Her heal is nice, however it's not enough to support an entire fleet on its own. The HMS support is practically useless, and the "only in DD/CL fleet" buff is W14 specific. She is pretty tanky in the tank slot; however, with her low HP her bulk against bosses is in doubt. Overall, she is a great ship.</p>

Barrage seems meh, the armor break is alright but not worth sacrificing a BB slot for, and the second skill in its entirety is purely a gimmick. Collection tier only.</p>

The only redeeming factor about her is the Air Raid Assistance CV buff, combined with her higher than average AA. HMS buff is not worth for the most part due to how situational and bad it is. Overall, she is alright as a carrier buffer, but useless outside of that.</p>

Skill 2 is practically useless in PvE (since if ships are almost dying something has gone wrong), and is mainly for stall memeing. Barrages are solid, and work great with AoA shot reduction.

She is guarenteed max critical damage/rate stacks at 30s into the battle, which is early enough to be relevant especially versus a boss. The sonar part of her skill is useless. The fast load from sortieing with 3 Italians is nice if you can fulfil the requirements, but it is not mandatory for her to be great. Overall, she is a great off-flag BB; typical event SR.</p>

Her skills are decent, and her high main gun efficiency give her decent damage despite 1 MGM. The second skill is all situational at best. Overall she is bad, but it could be worse; collection only.</p>

She gains the Torpedo spread reduction Limit Break benefit, but has subpar torpedos. Her mines are a neat gimmick, but are practically useless in standard gameplay. Overall, she is collection only.

                                    <p>Musashi is an off-flag capable BB with top tier damage and bulk. She has a guaranteed barrage on main gun fire, a variety of very strong self-buffs, and a crossfleet barrage to boot. She still prefers flagship due to barrage pattern, but can work off-flag. For the IJN Main Gun requirement, the best options are the Twin 410mm Kai (HE, no syncing),  the Triple 460mm (AP, no syncing), or Triple 410mm (AP, syncing). The enhanced barrage is a sizable upgrade, but since Musashi overkills most content in a good fleet regardless, it's fine to ignore it. For the IJN gear requirement, use the Type 1 AP Shell as an Auxilary. Overall, Musashi is amazing, and is highly worth getting.</p>

                                    <p>Wakatsuki is a hybrid-oriented DD best used as a middle-position damage dealer. She has solid stats with multiple barrages and MGM+1, which give her great bullet spam. She also has a secondary built-in ASW mount, which is nice in submarine-heavy areas but useless outside of that. Ignore the Akizuki-class sortie buff when using her, it is not needed at all for her to be good. Overall, she is solid; one of the best DDs currently.</p>

She has good enough HP, which coupled with her great Luck and Evasion (which can get boosted further from her torpedoes!) gives her high bulk. She also has a self-heal when the skill barrage activation fails. Her barrages and MGM are very mediocre for the role, however. Overall, she is a great pure tank, but has bad damage output for the role.</p>

                                    <p>Yorktown II is an amazing CV with amazing stats and skills. She has 9 planes, and great stats and efficiencies, making her damage output about equal to the other Rainbow CVs. Due to her barrages, she is best used against Light or Medium armor enemies, but still holds up very well against Heavy overall. Her support is amazing as well, with her AA resistance decrease, and additional USS CV damage buffs on top of it. Crossfleet is always nice to have as well. For the USS plane requirement, there are a lot of great options, check out a gear guide for more information. Amazing CV, highly worth getting.</p>

In addition, MGM+1 coupled with great stats and barrages make her damage really high for a CA. Great CA, highly worth getting.</p>

Bad surface damage drags her down, along with subpar bulk. Great CV buffer.</p>

In addition, her HP is too low for her to main tank. Her skill 1 buffs are very rng reliant on getting the right ones, and even then other buffers can do the job way better. Just use a ship that has high personal damage instead. Collection only.</p>

                                    <p>Yat Sen Retrofit is a damage-dealer oriented CL with great stats and skills. She always had enough bulk to main tank most mob content, but now that doesn't require Ning/Ping Hai. Her personal damage is vastly increased due to higher gun efficiencies and FP stat. In addition, she loses reliance on Ning/Ping Hai for her own bulk, although you still need her to buff Ning/Pings bulk in China Wall teams. Retrofit skill fires a decent barrage every 12s as well, which is decent free damage. Great improvement over base Yat Sen, and an above-average CL overall.</p>

Her skills are confusing, but for the most part your fleet is guaranteed max stacks of "No Mercy" every airstrike, giving her great damage output. Her support freezes the enemy, which is amazing for other BBs and CVs alike to land their shots/bombs/torpedoes. The crossfleet is basically negligible for most intentd and purposes though, since the effect is only once per battle. Overall, she is an amazing ship; highly worth getting.</p>

                                    <p>Royal Oak is a off-flag oriented BB with great stats and interesting skills. Her barrage is based upon taking damage or after 20s has passed, both of which allow her to run a shelling gun instead of a barrage gun. Her damage redirection is niche and her self heal is useless for most purposes since backline ships rarely take meaningful damage. She technically prefers flagship but is fine as an off-flag. Overall, typical event SSR. Not horrible but not top tier.</p>

The AoA is decent, the bombs are also decent, and the special submarines fire a decent number of torpedoes, all giving her great damage alongside the MGM+1 main gun. Overall, she is a great CA.</p>

In addition, the heal is very minor compared to using a dedicated healer (like Unicorn). Overall, she is collection only.</p>

Her skill 2, especially the Release part, gives her a summon that does great, consistent, damage to enemies on the field. Her crossfleet skill is decent, but KMS CVs aren't good enough yet to make a KMS CV fleet worthwhile. Overall, she is an amazing BB; highly worth getting.</p>

                                    <p>Regensburg is a damage-oriented CL with great stats and interesting skills. Her skills incentivize her being in a KMS fleet, which is suboptimal. In addition, her skill locks on to enemies every 15s, which doesn't sync well with current options. Furthermore, her skills give her more bonuses if there is a locked on enemy alive at the time of activation, which is unreliable outside of bossing. Her barrages are pretty good, but only 1 MGM hurts her damage. Overall, she is a good CL.</p>

Her skill 2 greately increases her bulk along with the 30% auxiliary stat boost from max limit-break. Despite the AoA reduction when using a CL gun, a DD gun will be better the majority of the time.

She gets torpedo crit rate and self torpedo buffs from her skills, further boosting her damage. In addition, her skill 3 allows her to spam a torpedo barrage, albeit a weak one.

                                    <p>Nelson Retrofit is a flagship-oriented BB with great stats and skills. She gains 15% more main gun efficiency, bringing her gun damage up to par with other SSR BBs. Her barrage proc rate also increases to 100%, although it still suffers the same issues as the original Big Seven (not arcing, not as single-target oriented). The single target barrage is decent, but nothing amazing. Overall, she is a great ship; one of the best easily acquirable BBs for new players.</p>

She also buffs French ships in the same fleet, however there aren't enough French ships currently to make this worthwhile.

                                    <p>Guichen is a mob-tank oriented CL with great stats and skills. Her damage is above average for a 1 MGM CL due to a good AoA which ignores shields and pierces, as well as her Skill 1. Her bulk is good enough to mob-tank, but not good enough against bosses. Her stop is not worth building a fleet around. Overall, she is a good CL.</p>

Her skill 2 heals both herself and the vanguard a good amount, but 5s after an airstrike is fired might be too slow for some fleet compositions. Compared to other healers, having 8 planes is a huge benefit to her own personal damage. Overall she is a great CV. </p>

                                    <p>Anchorage is a tank-oriented CA with great stats and amazing skills. Her bulk is very high due to her skills giving her barriers and invincibility throughout the fight, as well as a smokescreen. Her damage is still good as well due to MGM+1 CA guns and multiple barrages. You want to level her "Riddle Me This" skill due to the increase in damage you gain from it. Overall, she is the gold standard for tank CAs: an amazing ship.</p>

Her support is also very good, with a timestop improving your other ships's geometric accuracy against single-target enemies / bosses, as well as her aviation damage debuff. Overall, she is an amazing ship when her support is fully taken advantage of.  </p>

Her main guns are also very strong for a barrage-oriented BB, which allow her to be less reliant on RNG for her damage output. Her crossfleet skill is nice but nothing special. Overall, she is a great BB.</p>

                                    <p>Chikalov is a damage-oriented CV with high stats, solid skills, and a solid loadout. Her airstrike barrage is very strong (especially when enhanced), and her debuff barrage, despite the bullets being weak, has a good enough pattern to proc it reliably. Her slow is nice, but the short duration makes it hard to sync with other ships in the same fleet. Lack of a Fighter hurts her in AA areas unless you have an intercept-capable Torpedo Bomber. Overall, she is an amazing CV. </p>

She has a long range ghost gun for more free damage, as well as a great torpedo barrage off of it. She ideally prefers to be flagship due to her barrage pattern.

Her slow reload is concerning, but its impact on her viability is to be determined. Her special secondary guns are awful for interception, but are better than not having them at all. Needs further testing.</p>

Her damage output is among the best in the game for vanguard ships due to multiple main gun mounts, as well as her shield-ignoring ability from her skills. Needs further testing.</p>

She is still good as an off-flag, but for maximum performance you want her in the Flagship slot. Overall, she is a great BC, very worthy of being an SR.</p>

Due to her skill, she effectively gets a free salvo compared to the average BB/BC, which is always nice. Shields for the vanguard are always welcome as well. Overall, she seems solid; nothing exceptional but not bad either.</p>

                                    <p>Queen Elizabeth META is an off-flag damage-oriented BB with good stats and skills. Her shelling damage is average, but her barrages more than make up for it. The marking for META/HMS ships is pointless, and so is the random META ship in the fleet dealing more damage. You can sortie her with other META ships to get all her buffs, but that is not necessary for her to be viable. Overall, she is a great BB.</p>

Her skills are also decent, with good barrages and burns, but they are unreliable and don't improve her damage that much. Overall, she is an average CA.</p>

Both her barrages (S1, AoA) have priority targetting, which also help her personal damage out. Overall, she is a great CL.</p>

The slow is gimmicky, as well as the damage boost to certain factions. The +EVA to some meta ships is a joke since we only had 1 META vanguard before Memphis META (Helena META).
